creating the assignment:
  1. needed to review how bootstrap works (im not sure how to setup bootstrap)
  proceeded to go to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/ 
  and https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_get_started.php
  and https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

  - looked how bootstrap is used on the examples on the official bootstrap website and copied the style

  2. given the requirement to have an array of 20 images. I never want to manage those 20 hard coded contents my prof want us to create.
  i want to automate or make a scalable version. I used php for that thank god.
